    "In this section, we have built upon the MDP properties of the environment we wish to control, in order to characterize policies through their value functions.\n",

    "We have learned that:\n",
    "- $Q^\\pi$ is a solution to the Bellman evaluation equation\n",
    "$$Q = T^\\pi Q$$\n",
    "- $Q^*$ is a solution to the Bellman optimality equation\n",
    "$$Q = T^* Q$$\n",
    "- Value Iteration constructs the sequence of $Q_{n+1} = T^* Q_n$ value functions\n",

    "<div class=\"alert alert-success\">\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is an optimal strategy?**  \n",
    "An optimal policy is one that yields optimal cumulated rewards. It is a policy that is *greedy* with respect to an optimal value function $Q^*$. Such a value function obeys Bellman's optimality equation and can be computed via dynamic programming.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Still, we are dependent on a characterization of $\\pi^*$ that relies on the knowledge of the MDP.\n",
    "\n",
    "But we could imagine that we use a procedure that *learns* $Q_{n+1}$ from samples of $T^* Q_n$. If such samples can be obtained from interaction with the system to control, it might be possible to learn $Q^*$ without knowing the MDP: that's where we really start talking about *reinforcement learning*."
